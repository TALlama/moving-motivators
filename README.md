## What is this?

[Moving Motivators](https://management30.com/practice/moving-motivators/) is a way to determine what motivates youâ€¦ at work, at play, whatever. What makes you excited to do what you do? What makes you want to push forward?

By itself, it's a good exercise for one. This repository lets you make it a good exercise for a team.

## How does it work?

1. Pick someone to be the facilitator.
1. Print out a copy of the Motivators.
1. Give each person on the team the Motivator cards and have them force-rank the Motivators. They send their rankings to the facilitator and no one else.
1. The facilitator makes a `teams.js` file and puts the rankings inside.
1. The code makes pretty graphs.
1. You have a discussion about what the graphs show.

## What should we discuss?

You can go in lots of directions on this, but here are a few I've used.

### What did you think of this exercise?

This is a good starter. It gets everyone talking. They'll start saying why they put some things where, and what they thought things meant. There will be disagreements. That's okay; talk about them. If no one speaks up, here's a few other conversation starters.

#### What strategies did you use to place things?

Some people work from the inside out, others from the outside in. Some focus on the one-word title, others on the description, and some on the picture or the color. Some people group the motivators into tiers and then sort within those, while some take them all individually. Some people rank them taking into account the role they play in this team, as distinct from the role they play on other teams or even in their home life, while some think about their motivations more holistically.

#### What made ranking the motivators hard?

A forced sort is always going to present you with some hard choices, and the motivators are a good set because none of them are bad on the face of things. Which ones tripped people up.

### Here are the rankings with the names shorn off. Who do you think is who?

*Generage these graphs by using a baseline of each member and watching the icons at the bottom re-order.*

This lets everyone guess who's who, and see how well everyone knows everyone else. You can reveal who's who during the discussion and see if anyone's surprised.

### Here is the team's average ranking.

*Generate these graphs by dropping the "dots" and "voter" opacity to zero.*

#### Are you surprised by anything?

The order is the most obvious, but the gray "standard deviation" area being especially wide or thin is also remarkable.

#### Which of these rankings is surprising?

Maybe you thought everyone was in if for the Mastery, or that no one cared about Honor. Why the discrepancy?

#### Which of these rankings is what you expected?

Maybe your standup is always talking about Freedom, or your TPS reports have a line item for Order. Why is that motivation so highly prized? On the other hand, maybe you all knew that Status was going to be low. Why?

#### What about the big spread on $motivator

Large spreads mean there's wide variation on what motivates the team. Why might that be? Maybe different job titles or roles attract different people. Maybe there's simply disagreement about what the term meant.

#### What about the small spread on $motivator

Small spreads mean the team is all motivated similarly. Why would that be? Maybe this is core to what this team do. Maybe the team's interview process is selecting people for this motivation.

### Here is your distance graph

*Generate these graphs by showing "dots" and "voter" and focusing on each team member*

Where the black dotted line is higher than the gray one is where you feel more motivated than the team average. Where the black line is lower than the gray one is where you are less motivated than the team.

#### Which of these distances surprising?

Did you know you were the only one who was motivated by Acceptance?

#### Which of these distances is what you expected?

Did the team know you were the only one who was motivated by Acceptance?

### Reflections

#### Team fit

Do the tasks your team takes on reflect the motivations you've identified? When faced with a task that's in tension with those motivations, what do you do? Can you transmute those tasks into something better fitted to your team?

#### Hiring

When looking to bring more people into the team, it's likely that you've subconsciously reinforced these motivations in the past. Would it serve you well to continue doing so, or would mixing your teams' motivations allow your team to grow into new roles?
